      Some years before, I was a frequent user of automatic image retouching services.
      But as soon as I discovered the world of photo industry, I began to understand that this type of cooperation did not suit me at all.
      So, I referred to freelance photo retouchers but this co-working also did not satisfy me, that was rather slow.
      Then I addressed FixThePhoto. To make sure of their high-quality, I gave them one testing order with photo correction.
      Since then I have been successfully working with them for half a year. No hidden problems concerning pricing, no delays.
      This touch up service can be recommended.
